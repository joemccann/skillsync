# Logo Setup Instructions

The README has been updated to include the logo, but the image file needs to be saved manually.

## Required Action

Save the logo image file as:
```
.github/logo.png
```

The README is already configured to display it at the top with:
```html
<p align="center">
  <img src=".github/logo.png" alt="SkillSync Logo" width="400">
</p>
```

Once you save the logo.png file in the .github directory, the logo will display correctly on GitHub.
